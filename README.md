# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the **Machine Learning** project repository!

This repo includes practical machine learning mini-projects using real-world datasets. Each project explores a different ML concept, including regression, classification, and exploratory data analysis — built with **Python**, **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and **matplotlib**.
